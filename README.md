# Watson Developer Cloud iOS SDK: Chat App Example

This repository contains an example application to demonstrate how the Swift-based [Watson Developer Cloud iOS SDK](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/ios-sdk) can be consumed from an Objective-C application.

This example modifies the [JSQMessagesViewController](https://github.com/jessesquires/JSQMessagesViewController) demo application to add Watson services, including Speech to Text, Conversation, and Text to Speech.

_Please note that this project is still a work-in-progress!_
